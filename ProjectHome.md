This daemon enables multiple applications to use a single contact with the Apple Push Notification Service (APNS) in a simple way.

Clients (at the moment) connect to this service via a simple text based line protocol to send messages to APNS.  In the future http and https connectors (to client projects) will be added.

The main advantage of this is that client projects do not have to write code to connect to APNS in each and every project.
